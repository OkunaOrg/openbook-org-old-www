                </div>
                <p>
                    Social networks are undoubtedly one of the greatest inventions of the 21st century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They have redefined how we connect with our loved ones, how we save and share our most precious
                    moments, our politics, our economy, our world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We entrust them with our stories, ideas, goals, plans and wishes. We entrust them with ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is this trust deserved? Is the goal of these companies to help us connect with others or simply
                    making money?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We, like you, can't tell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why? Because these social networks operate behind walls. Walls of uncertainty, which as shown
                    recently, often turn out to be walls of deceit and dishonesty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to bring those walls down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>We want to build an open and secure social network we can all trust.</strong>

                    <h4 class="subtitle is-5">How will we create an open and secure social network?</h4>
                </div>

                <h3>1. Openness.</h3>
                <p>
                    From the code running in our servers to our our T-Shirt designs, every thing we do will be free and
                    open for everyone to see, reproduce and contribute to.</p>
                <p>
                    People will be able to see our intents in every line of code we write and will be able to confront
                    us at any moment. No unpleasant surprises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, if something awful were to happen to the network ( like being overtaken by people with
                    purely monetary interests ), with all of the code publicly available, anyone could setup their own
                    and carry on with the mission.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    2. Privacy and security.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Given our cyber security background, there is nothing we value more in a product than it's privacy
                    and security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will embed privacy and security in the core of everything we do.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    2.1 Data sharing with applications
                </h4>
                <p>
                    One of the great benefits of having a social media account these days is being able to use it to log
                    into other applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is done through data sharing. The social network shares the information the application <i>needs</i>
                    from you.
                </p>
                <h5>Example</h5>
                <p>This is what data sharing normally looks like. Go ahead, continue with <i>"Anchorbook"</i>.</p>
                <ob-generic-data-sharing></ob-generic-data-sharing>
                <p>Did you spot the problems?</p>
                <h5> Problem #1: What data did you actually share with the application?</h5>
                <p>
                    Can you name the exact data that was shared with the application?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might say, <i>"well of course, it says clearly public profile, friend list, birthday, likes and
                    email address"</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what is <i>"public profile"</i>? Did you click/hover the "<i
                    class="icon is-small fas fa-info-circle"></i>"
                    icon?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you do, you'll get some more information.
                </p>
                <p><i>"Your public profile includes name, profile picture, age, range, gender, language, country
                    <strong>and other public info</strong>."</i></p>
                <p>
                    Apart from wondering why in the world would a WiFi hotspot need any of these, it is still not clear
                    what data will be shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This to us is unacceptable.
                </p>
                <h5> Problem #2: Who determines what information does the application require from you?</h5>
                <p>
                    You might be thinking, <i>"what a silly question, the application of course"</i>, they are providing
                    a service, they know best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the current case in every social media. You register an application, configure what
                    information the application "needs" from your users, and you're done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, in a perfect world where all humans have good intentions for others this would work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly, in our world, companies often abuse this, and with no supervision, they request and store all
                    the information they can about you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be it to provide a service, analyze or sell your data. Once again, we don't know, and really, it
                    shouldn't be our responsibility to find out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Social media companies should be responsible for ensuring applications do not abuse data
                        sharing systems.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>All applications requesting access to user data should be closely examined, by real people, with the
                    privacy and security of their users as their guiding principles.</p>
                <h5> Problem #3: What happens to your information once it leaves the social network?</h5>
                <p>
                    So, you went ahead and hit <i>Continue</i>. What now?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where is that data?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you were to discover these WiFi hotspots are owned by an Evil Corporation gathering this
                    information for massive surveillance reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Could you un-athorize the data sharing? Could you delete your data from their systems?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer is no. Once the data is shared, there's no going back. There are no procedures for
                    tracking or deleting it.
                </p>
                <h5> Our solution</h5>
                <p>
                    These are all clear and serious problems that no social network as of today has been able to solve.
                </p>
                <p>The privacy and security of their users are perhaps simply not part of their priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    Well, they are part of ours.
                </p>
                <p>Here's our prototype. Go head click around.</p>
                <ob-openbook-data-sharing></ob-openbook-data-sharing>

                    Spot the differences? Here are the most important ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sharing our information is sharing a bit of ourselves. That is why we want to make sure it's
                    always crystal clear what is to be shared.
                </p>
                <p>We won't hide anything behind popups or behind vague descriptions such as "public information".</p>
                <p>We will be explicit about what information is to be shared and we will give you a way to inspect it yourself.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Safe applications
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will introduce the concept of safe applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These applications will be examined in depth by us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will make sure these applications
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Only request the information they need to provide the service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Know at all times where your data is stored physically and have this information available to
                        you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have provable procedures in place to delete your information from ALL of their systems if you
                        were to
                        revoke the permission.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We will then create an <i>Applications Overview</i> dashboard which will allow you to pinpoint the
                    location of all of your shared data, revoke it's access and most importantly, delete it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although we're fans of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track
                    initiative</a>. We strongly believe no <i>"Opt-out"</i>
                    should be required for people not to be monitored across the internet.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Privacy should be a default everywhere.</strong></p>
                <p>That is why we will not track you anywhere, anyhow, by default.</p>
                <h4> 2.3 Privacy and security as a journey, not a destination.</h4>
                <p>
                    We will continuously research and develop new ways to improve your privacy and security.

                    We, like you, have put a tremendous amount of our time and data into existing social networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why, we will make sure that, <strong>if the social network you are coming from provides a
                    way to
                    download your data, we will help you migrate it
                    all to our network</strong>.

                <p>
                    We are eager to bring this social network to life. To re-invent the way social media companies
                    operate. To claim back our privacy and security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It won't be an easy task. Apart from the obvious technical challenges, being the underdogs in an
                    industry with billions of dollars of revenue, we will be fought against, challenged and perhaps even
                    ridiculised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will need all the help we can get.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why we are currently working on a Kickstarter campaign where you like millions of others,
                    will be able
                    to help us bring the project to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will have some awesome perks for our supporters, including apparel, mugs, stickers and more!

                </div>
                <h3>
                    How will you make money?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Call us crazy but <strong>our business model is not and will never be advertisement</strong> (a.k.a.
                    your personal data).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will build Openbook to be a platform for peer to peer services such products and services
                    marketplaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, you could sell your beloved Star Wars DVD collection in the network in the same way you
                    could hire someone to walk your dog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Applications built in the platform will benefit from the privacy and security of the ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will also investigate the possibility of helping businesses setup their own internal social
                    networks based on Openbook as a service.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What if you don't meet your funding goals?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If we don't meet our funding goals, we hope to serve as inspiration for existing and upcoming social
                    networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope they take our ideas and implement them. We hope they put their users privacy and security
                    first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, we hope they realise new ways of making money can be thought of that don't involve
                    personal information.
