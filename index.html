                </div>
                <p>
                    Social networks are undoubtedly one of the greatest inventions of the 21st century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They have redefined how we connect with our loved ones, how we share our precious
                    moments, our politics, our economy, our world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We entrust them with our stories, ideas, goals, plans and wishes. We entrust them with ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is the trust deserved? Is the goal of these companies really to help us connect with others or
                    simply, to make money?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We, like you, can't tell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why? Because these social networks operate in secrecy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Behind walls of uncertainty, often proven to be also walls of deceit and dishonesty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to bring those walls down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>We want to build the first ever open and secure social network we can all trust.</strong>

                    <h4 class="subtitle is-5">How will we create an open and secure social network?</h4>
                </div>

                <h3>1. Openness.</h3>
                <p>
                    From the code running the network, to our T-Shirt designs, anything that does not compromise the
                    privacy and security of our users, will be free and
                    open for everyone to see, reproduce and contribute to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People will be able to see our intents in every line of code we write and will be able to hold us
                    accountable
                    for it. No tricks, no gimmicks, no unpleasant surprises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, if something awful were to happen to the network ( like being overtaken by people with
                    purely monetary interests ), with all of the code publicly available, anyone could setup their own
                    instance
                    and carry on with the mission.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    2. Privacy and security.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Given our background in information security, there is nothing we value more in a product than it's
                    privacy
                    and security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Privacy and security will be at the core of everything we do.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    2.1 Data sharing with applications
                </h4>
                <p>
                    One of the great benefits of having a social media account these days is being able to use it to log
                    into other applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is done through data sharing. The social network shares the information that the application
                    <i>needs</i>
                    from you.
                </p>
                <h5>Example</h5>
                <p>
                    This is what data sharing normally looks like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's say you find yourself in a cafeteria. You notice there's an open WiFi network and you connect
                    to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The box below appears in your screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>(Go ahead, click around as you would normally)</i>
                </p>
                <ob-generic-data-sharing></ob-generic-data-sharing>
                <p>
                    Did you spot the problems?
                </p>
                <h5> Problem #1: What data did you actually share with the application?</h5>
                <p>
                    Can you name the exact data that was shared with the application?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might say, <i>"well of course, it says clearly public profile, friend list, birthday, likes and
                    email address"</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what is <i>"public profile"</i>? And did you click/hover the "<i
                    class="icon is-small fas fa-info-circle"></i>"
                    icon?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you do, you will get some more information.
                </p>
                <p><i>"Your public profile includes name, profile picture, age, range, gender, language, country
                    <strong>and other public info</strong>."</i></p>
                <p>
                    Apart from wondering why in the world would a WiFi hotspot need any of this, what qualifies as <i>"other
                    public info"</i>?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>There is never a clear indication of the data being shared.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unacceptable.
                </p>
                <h5> Problem #2: Who determines what information the application requires from you?</h5>
                <p>
                    You might be thinking, <i>"what a silly question, the application developers of course"</i>, they
                    are providing
                    the service, they know best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And as it turns out, this is currently the case in all social media. The application developers
                    register and configure the data an application requires themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a perfect world where all humans have good intentions towards others, this would
                    work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our world, application developers more often than not, abuse this system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With no supervision whatsoever of the process, they request all the information they
                    can about their users. Whether they use the information to provide a service, analyze it, or sell
                    it, we can't ever know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And really, it shouldn't be up to us to find out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Social media companies should be responsible for ensuring that applications do not abuse
                        their
                        data
                        sharing systems.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>All applications requesting access to user data should be closely examined, by real people, with the
                    privacy and security of their users in mind at all times.</p>
                <h5> Problem #3: What happens to your information once it leaves the social network?</h5>
                <p>
                    So, you went ahead and hit <i>Continue</i>. What now?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where's the data?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if you were to discover these WiFi hotspots belong to your local government which is
                    gathering this
                    information as part of their mass-surveillance program?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Could you revoke the access to your data? But most importantly, could you delete it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer is no. Once the data is shared, there is no going back. There are no procedures for
                    tracking it or deleting it.
                </p>
                <h5> Our solution</h5>
                <p>
                    These are all clear and very serious problems that no social network as of today has been able to
                    address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the privacy and security of their users, is not part of their priorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are part of ours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is our prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's say now you downloaded the awesome music app everyone has been recommending to you. As soon as
                    you open the app, the box below shows up.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    Did you spot the differences?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are the most important ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Sharing our information is sharing a bit of ourselves. That is why we want to make sure it is
                    always crystal clear what is being shared.
                </p>
                <p>We won't hide anything behind pop-ups or behind vague descriptions such as "public information".</p>
                <p>We will be explicit about what information is to be shared and we will give you a way to inspect it

                    <li>
                        Know at all times where your data is stored physically and have this information available to
                        you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have provable procedures in place to delete your information from ALL of their systems if you
                        were to

                <h4> 2.2 Privacy first</h4>
                <p>
                    Although we are fans of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track
                    initiative</a>, we firmly believe no <i>"Opt-out"</i> should be necessary for companies NOT to
                    monitor around the internet.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Privacy should be a default everywhere.</strong></p>
                <p>
                    That is why, apart from not tracking you anywhere, by default, we will also only share the
                    data applications must have in order to provide a service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All optional data sharing will be disabled by default <sup class="is-size-7">1</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if an application does not require your friends list to provide a service but would
                    like to have it, this will be disabled by default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want the application to have this information, you can allow this with the flick of a switch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your data, your decision.
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-7">
                    <span>
                        [1] Currently, social networks enable all optional shared data by default.

                <p>
                    It won't be an easy task. Apart from the technical challenges, with our goal to disrupt a billion

                <h3>
                    Why now?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After years of using and seeing existing platforms make questionable choices when it comes to the
                    privacy
                    and security of its users, we decided enough was enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had hoped someone else would take on the challenge. That someone, somewhere would realize how
                    much of a difference this could make,
                    not only in the context of social networks, but in the context of the security and privacy of the
                    internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were several attempts, and some of them still exist to this day. Sadly sooner or later, they
                    all gave up to
                    pursue other markets like micro-communities and business solutions. Perhaps they thought going after
                    the social network giants was too big of a challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, it sure is. Luckily, we believe the greatest accomplishments of mankind are often the ones
                    that
                    posed the greatest challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, we are taking on the challenge.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How does Openbook differ from other established alternative social networks like Diaspora, Mastodon,
                    Friendica, etc.?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Briefly put, we are a privacy and security first social network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practically, this means we aim to have the functionality that MySpace, Facebook and other similar
                    networks have, but designed to be secure and privacy aware right from the start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some examples of this are
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        No tracking, within or outside the network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No deep learning algorithms analyzing your personal information together with your usage of the
                        platform to determine the content you are served (which are the source of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)" target="_blank">echo chambers</a>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        End to end encryption as the default way to communicate (even on the browser).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Absolute control of your data (decentralised platforms cant do this). Our data sharing policy is is strict and transparent. You will always know where all your data is physically located and be able to delete it. Even with third party applications.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Overall, other alternative social networks are too hard to use for normal people (like our grandpas and grandmas), try to fill in other market niches, or are making the same mistakes social media companies have made for the past few years in concern to the privacy and security of their users.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Call us crazy but <strong>our business model is not and will never be advertisement</strong> (also
                    known as

                <p>
                    We will build Openbook to be a platform for peer-to-peer services such as
                    marketplaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, you could sell your beloved Star Wars collection on the network in the same way you
                    could hire someone to walk your dog.

                    Applications built within the platform will benefit from the privacy and security of the ecosystem.

                <p>
                    Apart from this, we are also looking into offering business services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would offer them help setting up their own private internal Openbook networks with extra business
                    features such as event planning, team work planning, payslips management and identity management.

                    What if you don't meet your funding goals?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If we don't meet our funding goals, we hope to serve as an inspiration for existing and upcoming
                    social
                    networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope they take note of our ideas and implement them. We hope they put their users privacy and
                    security
                    first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, we hope they realise new ways of making money can be thought of that don't involve
                    monetizing the
                    personal information of their users.
