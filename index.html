                </div>
                <p>
                    Social networks are undoubtedly one of the greatest inventions of the 21st century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They have redefined how we connect with our loved ones, how we save and share our most precious
                    moments, our politics, our economy, our world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We entrust them with our stories, ideas, goals, plans and wishes. We entrust them with ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is this trust deserved? Is the goal of these companies to help us connect with others or simply
                    making money?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We, like you, can't tell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why? Because these social networks operate behind walls. Walls of uncertainty, which as shown
                    recently, often turn out to be walls of deceit and dishonesty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to bring those walls down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>We want to build an open and secure social network we can all trust.</strong>

                    <h4 class="subtitle is-5">How will we create an open and secure social network?</h4>
                </div>

                <h3>1. Openness.</h3>
                <p>
                    From the code running in our servers to our our T-Shirt designs, every thing we do will be free and
                    open for everyone to see, reproduce and contribute to.</p>
                <p>
                    People will be able to see our intents in every line of code we write and will be able to confront
                    us at any moment. No unpleasant surprises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, if something awful were to happen to the network ( like being overtaken by people with
                    purely monetary interests ), with all of the code publicly available, anyone could setup their own
                    and carry on with the mission.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    2. Privacy and security.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Given our cyber security background, there is nothing we value more in a product than it's privacy
                    and security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will embed privacy and security in the core of everything we do.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    2.1 Data sharing with applications
                </h4>
                <p>
                    One of the great benefits of having a social media account these days is being able to use it to log
                    into other applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is done through data sharing. The social network shares the information the application <i>needs</i>
                    from you.
                </p>
                <h5>Example</h5>
                <p>Go ahead, click around.</p>
                <div class="columns is-mobile">
                    <div class="column is-narrow">
                        <div class="box">
                            <button class="button is-generic-social-media">
                                <span class="icon">
                                    <i class="fas fa-anchor"></i>
                                </span>
                                <span>
                                    Continue with Anchorbook
                                </span>
                            </button>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Did you spot the problems? Let us give you hand.</p>

                <h5> Problem #1: What data did you share with the application?</h5>
                <p>
                    Can you name the exact data that was shared with the application?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might say, <i>"well of course, it says clearly public profile, friend list, birthday, likes and
                    email address"</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what is public profile really? Did you click/hover the "<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>" icon?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you do, you'll get some more information.
                </p>
                <p><i>"Your public profile includes name, profile picture, age, range, gender, language, country <strong>and other public info</strong>."</i></p>
                <p>
                    Apart from wondering why in the world would a WiFi hotspot need any of these, it is still not clear what data will be shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This to us is  unacceptable.
                </p>
                <h5> Problem #2: Who determines what information does the application require from you?</h5>
                <p>
                    You might be thinking, <i>"what a silly question, the application of course"</i>, they are providing
                    a service, they know best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the current case in every social media. You register an application, configure what
                    information the application "needs" from your users, and you're done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, in a perfect world where all humans have good intentions for others this would work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly, in our world, companies often abuse this, and with no supervision, they request and store all
                    the information they can about you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be it to provide a service, analyze or sell your data. Once again, we don't know, and really, it
                    shouldn't be our responsibility to find out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Social media companies should be responsible for ensuring applications do not abuse data
                        sharing systems.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>All applications requesting access to user data should be closely examined, by real people, with the
                    privacy and security of their users as their guiding principles.</p>
                <h5> Problem #3: What happens to your information once it leaves the social network?</h5>
                <p>
                    So, you went ahead and hit <i>Continue</i>. What now?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where is that data?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you were to discover these WiFi hotspots are owned by an Evil Corporation gathering this information for massive surveillance reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Could you un-athorize the data sharing? Could you delete your data from their systems?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer is no. Once the data is shared, there's no going back. There are no procedures for tracking or deleting it.
                </p>
                <h5> Our solution</h5>
                <p>
                    These are all clear and serious problems that no social network as of today has been able to solve.
                </p>
                <p>The privacy and security of their users are simply not part of their priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    Well, guess what? They are part of ours.
                </p>
                <p>Here's our example. Go head click around.</p>
                <p>
                    Spot the differences? Here are the most important ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sharing our information is sharing a bit of ourselves. And that is why we want to make sure it's
                    always crystal clear what is to be shared.
                </p>
                <p>We won't hide anything behind popups, behind vague descriptions such as "public information".
                    Simplicity and honesty all the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Secure applications
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will introduce the concept of secure applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These applications will be examined in depth by us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will make sure that these applications
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Only request the information they need to provide the service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Know at all times where your data is.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have provable procedures in place to delete your information from ALL of their systems if you were to
                        revoke the permission.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                <h4> 2.2 No tracking by default</h4>
                <p>
                    Although we're fans of the <a href="">Do Not Track initiative</a>. We strongly believe no <i>"Opt-out"</i> should be required for people not to be monitored across the internet.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Privacy should be a default everywhere.</strong></p>
                <p>That is why we will not track you anywhere, anyhow, by default.</p>
